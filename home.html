					<p>
						It was January 2014 when Chinooks Roast & Fried Chicken was first introduced in the market. Founded by a Chinese Entrepreneur named Mr.
						Bernard Chua, the brand was launched as a mom-and-pop set up selling fried chicken in a busy street of Malabon City
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In the year 2018, the owner began to offer roasted chicken. The simple idea behind the name CHINOOKS was the word combination of "Chinese
						and Manok" and Roast & Fried Chicken as we offer both fried and roasted chicken.
